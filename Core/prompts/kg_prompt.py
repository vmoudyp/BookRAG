ENTITY_EXTRACTION = """-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: A brief, one-sentence description summarizing the entity's role or attributes based *only* on the provided text. If the text offers limited information, keep the description simple (e.g., "A person mentioned in the text."). Do not add any external knowledge.
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2.  From the entities identified in Step 1, identify all pairs of (`source_entity`, `target_entity`) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other based **only** on the provided text.
* **Crucial Rule**: The `source_entity` and `target_entity` for any relationship **must exactly match** an `entity_name` from the list you generated in Step 1. Do not create new entities or list relationships for entities not found in Step 1.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: A brief explanation for the relationship, using evidence found directly in the text.
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Preserve entity names exactly as they appear in the source text (do not translate them). Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Text:
They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.

The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation

-Goal-
Act as a sophisticated information extraction system. Your task is to analyze a JSON object containing an HTML table and a textual description. You must identify all relevant entities, formatting the output as a single, valid JSON object that adheres to the provided Pydantic schema.

---
-Steps-

1.  **Analyze the Input:** Carefully examine the entire input JSON, which includes an `html_table` and a `description`. The `description` provides crucial context for interpreting the table's data.

2.  **Identify Entities:**
    * **Crucial First Step: The Table Itself**: You **MUST** identify the table as the very first entity. Its `entity_type` must be `TABLE` and it **must** be the first object in the final `entities` list. **This is a non-negotiable rule.** Use its title or caption as its `entity_name` and create a description summarizing its content and purpose.
    * **For Column Headers:** You **MUST** extract each column header (e.g., 'Roberta', 'T5') as a distinct entity. Use the table's overall context to determine its `entity_type`.
    * **For Row Headers:** You **MUST** extract each row header (e.g., 'FewNERD (NER)') as a distinct entity. Use the table's overall context to determine its `entity_type`.
    * **From the Description:** Extract any additional relevant entities mentioned in the `description` text.
    * **Create Entity Objects:** For each unique entity found, create a JSON object following the `Entity` structure. The `description` for each entity should be a summary synthesized **strictly from its role and associated data within the provided `html_table` and `description` text only. Do not use any external knowledge.**

3.  **Construct the Final Output:** Combine all identified entities and relationships into the final JSON object, ensuring it strictly follows the specified output format.

TABLE_DESCRIPTION_EXTRACTION = """
-Goal-
Act as a precise Information Extraction system. Your task is to analyze a table's description and its column headers to extract all relevant entities.

---
-Instructions-
1.  **Analyze Both Inputs:** You will receive a JSON object containing two keys:
    * `"description"`: A text providing the overall context of the table.
    * `"column_headers"`: A list of strings representing the headers of the table columns.
    You must carefully analyze **both** sources of information.
    
2.  **Identify the Primary Table Entity:** Your most important first step is to create an entity for the table itself.
  * Its `entity_type` **MUST** be `TABLE`.
  * It **MUST** be the very first object in the final `entities` list.
  * Use the title from the `description` (e.g., "Table 1") as its `entity_name`.

3.  **Synthesize Entities from Headers:** This is a mandatory step. You must process every non-empty string in the `column_headers` list. Your task is to **synthesize**, not just split, the hierarchical parts into a single, natural entity name. For example, from `"ACE (ED) > 10-shot"`, extract a single entity named `"10-shot ACE (ED)"`.

4.  **Extract Remaining Entities from Description:** After handling the table and column headers, scan the `description` text again to find any additional relevant entities that have not yet been extracted.

5.  **Format the Final Output:** Your response **must be a single, valid JSON object** with a single root key named `entities`.

TABLE_BODY_EXTRACTION = """
-Goal-
Act as a precise, row-by-row information extraction engine. Your task is to analyze a batch of **semi-structured row data strings**. You must **correlate** each row's data with the provided **`column_headers`**, using the main **`description`** for overall context, to extract all relevant entities found strictly within the row data.

---
-Instructions-

1.  **Use Context, Don't Extract From It:** First, carefully study the `description` and `column_headers`. Use this information **strictly as context** to understand the row data's meaning and to assign correct entity types. **Do not** extract entities that appear only in the `description` or `column_headers`.

2.  **Correlate and Extract from Each Row:** Iterate through each `row_string` in the `rows_batch` list. For each string:
    * It represents a single table row, with cells likely separated by a delimiter (e.g., '|').
    * You must mentally map the data cells in the string to their corresponding header in the `column_headers` list based on their order.
    * Extract entities from the row's **categorical data** (e.g., names of models, methods, or groups like 'CODEX' or 'SLM + LLM'). You generally **should NOT** extract entities from purely **numerical data** (e.g., '53.8(0.5)').
    * **Minimum Extraction Mandate:** Each row string describes a primary subject. You **must** aim to extract **at least one main entity** from each row, representing the subject of that row (e.g., the specific model or method being evaluated).

3.  **Consolidate and Format:** Collect all unique entities found across all rows into a single list. Your final response **must be a single, valid JSON object** with a single root key named `entities`.

4.  **Strict Extraction Boundaries:** This is the final and most important rule.
    * All extracted entities **MUST** originate from the data within the `rows_batch` strings.
    * Therefore, you **MUST NOT** extract entities that appear *only* in the `description` or `column_headers`. These are for context only.
    * You also **MUST NOT** create an entity for the table itself (e.g., 'Table 1').

IMAGE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION = """
-Goal-
Act as an expert AI system for visual and semantic analysis. Your primary task is to **comprehensively** analyze a given image and an accompanying textual description. You must identify **all possible** relevant entities, formatting the output as a single, valid JSON object that adheres to the provided Pydantic schema.

---
-Steps-

1.  **Analyze Full Context:** Carefully examine both the provided image and the textual `description`. The `description` often provides crucial context, names, or other details that are not visually obvious.

2.  **Identify Entities:**
    * **Crucial First Step: The Image Itself**. You **MUST** identify the entire image as the very first entity. Its `entity_type` **must** be `IMAGE` and it **must** be the first object in the final `entities` list. **This is a non-negotiable rule.** If the description provides a title or figure number (e.g., 'Figure 2'), use that as the `entity_name`; otherwise, use the first few words of the description as the entity name. If the description is empty, use 'The Image' as the entity name.
    * **From Visual Objects:** Identify distinct physical objects, people, animals, and general locations shown in the image.
    * **From Text Within the Image (High Priority):** Pay attention to any text inside the image, such as labels, titles, annotations, or data points in diagrams and flowcharts. **This text is a critical source of entities.** You **MUST** treat every distinct label, title, or significant term as a candidate for an entity.
    * **From the Description:** Extract any additional relevant entities mentioned in the text that might not be visible or clearly identifiable in the image.
    * **Principle of Comprehensiveness:** When in doubt, it is better to extract a potential entity than to omit it. **Be thorough and aim for maximum detail.**
    * **Create Entity Objects:** For each unique entity found, create a JSON object following the `ExtractEntity` structure.

3.  **Construct the Final Output:** Combine all identified entities into a single JSON object with the root keys "entities", ensuring it strictly follows the specified output format.

---

SECTION_ENTITY_EXTRACTION = """
-Goal-
You are a highly specialized knowledge extraction engine for structured documents. Your task is to analyze a single section title, its hierarchical context, and its surrounding sections to extract a comprehensive set of entities and their relationships.

-Context-
You will receive a primary JSON input containing:
1.  `context`: An object detailing the title's position in the document (its full path, previous title, and next title).
2.  `title_to_process`: The specific title string you need to analyze.

You MUST use this full context to inform your extraction, especially for generating rich descriptions.

-Instructions & Extraction Logic-

1.  **Create the Main Section Entity**:
    * First, create one primary entity for the `title_to_process` itself.
    * Its `entity_type` **MUST** be `SECTION_TITLE`.
    * Its `description` **MUST** be a rich summary that explains the section's role, using the provided `context` (e.g., "As a subsection of 'Methodology', this section details...").

2.  **Extract Sub-Entities (If Applicable)**:
    * Next, analyze the text of the `title_to_process` to determine if it contains multiple, distinct conceptual entities.
    * **If** the title clearly lists separate concepts (e.g., from "Task, Dataset and Evaluation"), you **MUST** extract each one as a sub-entity.
    * **If** the title represents a single, indivisible concept (e.g., "Introduction"), then **no sub-entities should be extracted**, and you can skip to Step 4.
    * For any extracted sub-entity, you must assign the most accurate `entity_type` from the allowed list:
    {entity_types}

3.  **Create Relationships (If Sub-Entities Were Extracted)**:
    * **If, and only if,** you extracted one or more sub-entities in Step 2, you **MUST** create relationships to link them to the main section entity created in Step 1.
    * For each sub-entity, create one relationship where the sub-entity is the source (`src_entity_name`) and the main section entity is the target (`tgt_entity_name`).
    * The relationship description should clarify that the sub-entity is a topic of the section.

4.  **Final Output**:
    * Combine the main section entity, all sub-entities, and all relationships into a single JSON object adhering to the output format below.

You must intelligently merge their information into a single, comprehensive, and canonical entity. The final output must be a single, valid JSON object that adheres to the provided schema.

---
-Context-

---
-Instructions & Steps-

1.  **Determine the Canonical `entity_name`**:
    * First, check if one name is an abbreviation or acronym of the other (e.g., "LLM" and "Large Language Model"). If so, create a new, combined name that includes both, such as `Large Language Model (LLM)`.
    * Otherwise, if the names are simply different versions (e.g., "Apple" and "Apple Inc."), choose the more formal or complete one.
    * If the names are identical, simply use that name.

2.  **Determine the Canonical `entity_type`**:
    * Analyze `entity_1.entity_type` and `entity_2.entity_type`.
    * Select the most specific and accurate type that is available in the `-Allowed Entity Types-` list provided below. For example, `MODEL_OR_ARCHITECTURE` is more specific than `PRODUCT`.
    * Your final choice **MUST** be one of the types from the allowed list:
    {entity_types}

3.  **Synthesize the Comprehensive `description`**:
    * Read and understand both `entity_1.description` and `entity_2.description`.
    * Combine all unique, non-contradictory facts from both descriptions into a single, coherent paragraph.
    * If you find contradictions, use your reasoning to resolve them or state the most likely fact.
    * The final description should be written in the third person and be as informative as possible.

4.  **Construct the Final JSON Output**:
    * Assemble the chosen `entity_name`, `entity_type`, and the synthesized `description` into a single JSON object that matches the required output format.

ENTITY_RESOLUATION_PROMPT = """
-Goal-
You are an expert Entity Resolution Adjudicator. Your task is to determine if a "New Entity" refers to the exact same real-world concept as one of the "Candidate Entities" provided from a knowledge graph. Your output must be a JSON object containing the ID of the matching candidate (or -1) and a brief explanation for your decision.


---
-Context-
You will be given one "New Entity" recently extracted from a text. You will also be given a list of "Candidate Entities" that are semantically similar, retrieved from an existing knowledge base. Each candidate has a unique `id` for you to reference.

---
-Core Task & Rules-

1.  **Analyze the "New Entity"**: Carefully read its name, type, and description to understand what it is.

2.  **Field-by-Field Adjudication**: To determine a match, you must evaluate each field with a specific focus:
    * **`entity_name` (High Importance):** The names must be extremely similar, a direct abbreviation (e.g., "LLM" vs. "Large Language Model"), or a well-known alias. **If the names represent distinct, parallel concepts (like "Event Detection" and "Named Entity Recognition"), they are NOT a match, even if their descriptions are very similar.**
    * **`entity_type` (Medium Importance):** The types do not need to be identical, but they must be closely related and compatible (e.g., `COMPANY` and `ORGANIZATION` could describe the same entity).
    * **`description` (Contextual Importance):** The descriptions may differ as they are often extracted from different parts of a document. Your task is to look past surface-level text similarity and determine if they fundamentally describe the **same underlying object or concept**.

3.  **Be Strict and Conservative**: Your standard for a match must be very high. An incorrect merge can corrupt the knowledge graph. A missed merge is less harmful.
    * Surface-level similarities are not enough. The underlying concepts must be identical.
    * For example, "Apple" (the fruit) and "Apple Inc." (the company) are NOT a match.
    * **When in doubt, you MUST output -1.**
    * **Assume No Match by Default**: In a large knowledge graph, most new entities are genuinely new. You should start with the assumption that the "New Entity" is unique. You must find **strong, convincing evidence** across all fields, especially the `entity_name`, to overturn this assumption and declare a match.

4.  **Format the Output**: **You must provide your answer in a valid JSON format. The JSON object should contain two keys:**
    * `select_id`: An integer. The `id` of the candidate you've determined to be an exact match. If no exact match is found, this value MUST be `-1`.
    * `explanation`: A brief, one-sentence string explaining your reasoning. For a match, explain why they are the same entity. For no match, explain the key difference.

    "Your primary goal is to determine if a 'Candidate Entity' and a 'Query Entity' "
    "refer to the exact same real-world entity. This is a task of semantic identity verification, "
    "not just textual similarity.\n\n"
    "Even though their descriptions may not be identical (as they are extracted from "
    "various sources), you must analyze the information presented in them. Your decision "
    "should be based on whether this information, when combined, points to a single, "
    "unique real-world entity. Be aware that in some cases, it is expected that "
    "NONE of the provided candidates will be a correct match.\n\n"
    "A high score (e.g., >0.9) means you are highly confident they are the same entity, despite "
    "variations in their descriptions. A low score means they are fundamentally different entities, "
    "even if their names or descriptions share some keywords."

ROLE_EXTRACTION = """-Goal-
You are an information extraction system. Given a passage of text and a list of named entities
(persons or organizations), identify any domain roles (job titles, political offices, organizational
positions) that those entities hold as explicitly described in the text.

-Entity List-
{entity_list}

-Text-
{input_text}

-Rules-
1. Only extract roles EXPLICITLY stated in the text. Do not infer or hallucinate.
2. Only assign roles to entities present in the entity list above.
3. If an entity holds multiple roles, include one entry per role.
4. If no roles are found, return {{"roles": []}}.
5. Do not use honorifics (Mr., Dr.) as role names; extract the actual position title
   (e.g., "Minister of Finance", not "Dr.").
6. For tenure_status, use: current, former, acting, interim, candidate, or unknown.

-Output Format-
Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching this schema:

{{
  "roles": [
    {{
      "entity_name": "<exact name from entity list>",
      "role_name": "<role title from text>",
      "scope_entity_name": "<org/country this role is within, or null>",
      "tenure_status": "<current|former|acting|interim|candidate|unknown>",
      "evidence_text": "<short supporting quote or close paraphrase from the text>",
      "confidence": <0.0-1.0>
